# How to build project files

1. Clone the repo

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/banna12345bob/GMTK25`

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

2. Generate the project

In the repository that you just cloned, run the batch file `GenProjs\GenerateProjects - VS2022.bat`

**(At the moment the only IDE supported is Visual Sudio 2022 or later)**
